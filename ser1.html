    <u> <h1 class="animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInRight ">Are You Fit for Service</h1></u>
    
    <p>

       <span> Introduction:</span> Hey everyone! I want to talk to you today about a topic that's close to my heart: being fit for service. 
       You know, we all have a purpose in this life, and God has called each of us to serve Him and make a difference in the world.<span>Body:</span> You see, God's call to service is not just for pastors or missionaries.
        It's for each and every one of us. In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus tells us to go and make disciples of all nations. And in Ephesians 2:10, we're reminded that we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works. So, it's clear that God has uniquely gifted each of us for a specific purpose. 
        Now, let's take a moment to reflect on our own readiness for service. Are our hearts aligned with God's? Do we have the right motives? Are we truly committed to serving Him? Being fit for service means having a humble heart, being obedient to God's leading, and having a servant's heart. 
        Sometimes, we may face obstacles that hinder us from fully embracing our call to service. Fear, insecurity, or feeling inadequate can hold us back. 
        But remember, God doesn't call the equipped; He equips the called. Just look at Moses and Esther in the Bible. They overcame their obstacles and stepped into their calling. 
        To be fit for service, we need to develop our spiritual fitness. That means spending time in prayer, studying God's Word, and cultivating a vibrant relationship with Him.
         It's through this connection with God that we receive the strength and wisdom we need to serve Him effectively. <span> Lastly, </span>being fit for service means serving others with love and compassion. 
         Jesus showed us the way through His own example. 
         Let's follow in His footsteps and make a difference in the lives of those around us. 
         Whether it's volunteering, helping a neighbor, or simply showing kindness, our acts of service can have a powerful impact. 
         <span>Conclusion:</span> So, my friends, as we wrap up today, I want to leave you with this question: Are you fit for service? Take a moment to reflect on your own readiness
